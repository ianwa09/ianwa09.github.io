          Me (yellow shirt) mentoring students at the summer camp that I hosted
          with my robotics team. We taught subjects such as hardware, coding the
          robot, business presentation skills, and created a mock-competition
          for the students (middle school). We particularly sparked an interest
          in a student named Kenny, who chose to sign up for our team at the end
          of the camp. The camp was a week-long camp that lasted the entire day.
