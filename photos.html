          Me (left) with the students I helped mentor at the summer camp we
          hosted in 2023. We taught subjects such as hardware, coding the robot,
          business presentation skills, and created a mock-competition for the
          students (middle school). We particularly sparked an interest in a
          student named Kenny, who chose to sign up for our team at the end of
          the camp. The camp was a week-long camp that lasted the entire day.
